rGame
=====

A Flash game project for IST 297G. The game involves escaping some type of enemy by running away.
A development journal from this project will be made available for viewing at a later date.

Controls aren't yet implemented. Undoubtedly strange for a game, but I have been working heavily on managing the components and frame-rate. Controls are fairly simple to implement, so I have pushed them back a bit.

Compile using FlashDevelop 4.0 after opening game.as3proj.
